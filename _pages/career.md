## Professional Experiences
* **Sep 2020-present**: After a multi-year collaboration with several successfull freelance projects I joined the quantum computing startup [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/)
as VP of Quantum Software. I am responsible for building the software infrastructure for running quantum computing simulations on different platforms, improving existing
quantum algorithms and devising new ones. I am working mainly on the cloud infrastructure of the company (running on AWS) and with [IBM Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) 
and [AWS Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) for quantum algorithms development. Stay tuned for some amazing news coming in 2021.
* **Sep 2019- Sep 2020**: Product Research and Innovation Lead at Forescout Technologies. I am responsible 
for the product innovation roadmap and I contribute to shape the future product vision.
I am also an active member of the central software architecture team in charge of
defining and guiding the design for on-going migration to a cloud-only platform.
* **Apr 2018- Sep 2019**: Research Engineer at SecurityMatters, recently acquired by Forescout, working on cybersecurity 
for critical infrastructures. I mainly focus on innovative algorithms for correlationg security events to help 
security analysts and field engineers in better protecting their organizations. 
I also supervised several master students (see for example [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/insecurity-of-video-surveillance-systems-in-building-automation-s)) 
on different cybersecurity topics. 
* **Aug 2016- Mar 2018**: Research Engineer at Atos Bull in Grenoble, working on developing application and network 
library for the [Sequana supercomputer](https://atos.net/en/products/high-performance-computing-hpc/bullsequana-x-supercomputers).

## Education
* **2019**: [Design Driven Business Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/open-programmes-abs/design-driven-business-innovation/design-driven-business-innovation.html) 
course at the 
Amsterdam Business School. This 3-months course focuses on how to ideate and execute
valuable innovation projects within a corporate environment and ends with an individual
innovation project proposal.
* **2016-2018**: PhD in computational physics from the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris with a [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01478313v1) on the application of quantum Monte Carlo techniques to high-temperature superconductors. During the PhD I worked a lot with parallel computing and with
some of the [most powerful](https://www.riken.jp/en/collab/resources/kcomputer/) supercomputers 
in the world.
* **2011-2013**: [Master in Physics of Complex Systems](https://areeweb.polito.it/didattica/pcs/) from the Polytechnic University of 
Turin with a thesis on material simulation for fuel cells development.
