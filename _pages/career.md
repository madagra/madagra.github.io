## Professional Experiences
* **2019-present**: Product Innovation Lead in the Industrial business unit of Forescout. I am responsible 
for the product innovation roadmap and I contribute to shape the future product vision.
I am also an active member of the Software Architecture team in charge of
defining and guiding the design for the future cloud-ready product architecture.
* **2019-present**: besides my main job I am also a collaborator of the quantum computing firm [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/) developing software for running chemistry simulations on quantum computers. I mainly contribute to developing the code infrastructure for the quantum computing software and occasionally I have fun designing and implementing some simple quantum algorithms to be 
used for teaching purposes.
* **2018-2019**: Research Engineer at SecurityMatters, recently acquired by Forescout, working on cybersecurity for critical infrastructures and security event correlation and visualization. 
I also supervised several master students (see for example [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/insecurity-of-video-surveillance-systems-in-building-automation-s)) 
on different cybersecurity topics. 
* **2016-2018**: Research Engineer at Atos Bull in Grenoble, working on developing application and network library for the [Sequana supercomputer](https://atos.net/en/products/high-performance-computing-hpc/bullsequana-x-supercomputers).

## Education
* **2019**: [Design Driven Business Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/open-programmes-abs/design-driven-business-innovation/design-driven-business-innovation.html) course at the 
Amsterdam Business School. This 3-months course focuses on how to ideate and execute
valuable innovation projects within a corporate environment and ends with an individual
innovation project proposal.
* **2016-2018**: PhD in computational physics from the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris with a [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01478313v1) on the application of quantum Monte Carlo techniques to high-temperature superconductors. During the PhD I worked a lot with parallel computing and with
some of the [most powerful](https://www.riken.jp/en/collab/resources/kcomputer/) supercomputers in the world.
* **2011-2013**: [Master in Physics of Complex Systems](https://areeweb.polito.it/didattica/pcs/) from the Polytechnic University of Turin with a thesis on material simulation for fuel cells development.
