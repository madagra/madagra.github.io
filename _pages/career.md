## Professional Experiences
* **2019-present**: Innovation Lead at Forescout responsible for the roadmap for product innovation and for shaping the future product vision. 
I am also part of the Software Architecture team in charge of migrating the current product to a cloud-ready architecture.  
* **2019-present**: besides my main job I am also a consultant for the quantum computing firm [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/) developing software for running chemistry simulation on quantum computers. I mainly contribute to developing the code infrastructure for the quantum computing software and occasionally I have fun designing
and implementing some simple quantum algorithms to be used for teaching purposes.
* **2018-2019**: Research engineer at SecurityMatters, recently acquired by Forescout, working on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and correlation
and visualization of security events. I also supervised several master [students](https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/insecurity-of-video-surveillance-systems-in-building-automation-s) on different cybersecurity topics. 
* **2016-2018**: Research engineer at Atos Bull in Grenoble, working on developing application and network library for the [Sequana supercomputer](https://atos.net/en/products/high-performance-computing-hpc/bullsequana-x-supercomputers).

## Education 
* **2016-2018**: PhD in computational physics from the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris with a [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01478313v1) on the application of quantum Monte Carlo techniques to high-temperature superconductors. During the PhD I worked a lot with parallel computing and with
some of the [most powerful](https://www.riken.jp/en/collab/resources/kcomputer/) supercomputers in the world.
* **2011-2013**: [Master in Physics of Complex Systems](https://areeweb.polito.it/didattica/pcs/) from the Polytechnic University of Turin with a thesis on material simulation for fuel cells development.
