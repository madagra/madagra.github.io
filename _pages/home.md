**Dear Internet surfer, welcome to my personal website!** 

I am Mario Dagrada, a researcher, developer and technology enthusiast living in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

If you are viewing this page, it means that you probably know me or are interested in my profile or my services. Here
you will find both information on my experiences and my past, current and (why not?) never started projects. Occasionally I will
also post some reviews or advice on books and other interesting stuff.


## Professional Interests

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge. 
> -- John Naisbitt

I am interested in (way too) many topics, but currently I am mostly focusing on the following:
* Software architecture for distributed applications: working hard for migrating from a legacy, monolothic design to a modern, cloud-ready architecture. 
* Correlation algorithms and big data analytics techniques applied to network security events: I am struggling to make security analysts' life easier.
* Business innovation and design thinking for innovation projects in the cybersecurity field. I am currently attending the [Design Driven Business Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/open-programmes-abs/design-driven-business-innovation/design-driven-business-innovation.html) course in Amsterdam.

A part from the above, I also try to keep an eye on the hot topics in physics and especially the quantum Monte Carlo community I contributed to during my PhD.
And of course deep learning has arrived [there](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02487) too. 

I am also sometimes brushing up my physics knowledge with a fruitful
collaboration with the quantum computing firm [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/). 

## Some of my projects

### qucochemistry
A [open source library](https://github.com/qu-co/qucochemistry) for compiling and running quantum chemistry algorithms on the Rigetti's Forest quantum computing platform. In this project, done in collaboration with [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/) I mainly contributed to the software infrastructure, unit testing
and code refactoring. More coming soon.

### TurboRVB
A very efficient and massively parallelized software package for executing quantum Monte Carlo simulation of materials. I developed it during my PhD
thesis by adding new techniques for simulating solid materials. Unfortunately the code is still closed-source, which will hopefully change in the
future. You can find some more information [here](https://people.sissa.it/~sorella/web/index.html) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06205).

### minjob
A very simple Python library used for monitoring threads and subprocesses and restarting them in case of critical exception. You can see the code
on [GitHub](https://github.com/madagra/minjob).

### surfbot
A simple bot for "surfing" on the very unstable cryptocurrency market. The code will soon be released open source.
