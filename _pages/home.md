**Dear Internet surfer, welcome to my personal website!** 

I am Mario Dagrada, a researcher and developer of Italian origins currently based in The
Netherlands.

If you are viewing this page, it means that you probably know me or are interested in my profile or my services. Here
you will find both information on my experiences and my past, current and (why not?) never started projects. Occasionally I will
also post some reviews or advice on books and other interesting stuff.

## In a nutshell

## Interests

## Some of my projects
