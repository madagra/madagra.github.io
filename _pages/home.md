**Dear Internet surfer, welcome to my personal website!** 

I am Mario Dagrada, a researcher, developer and technology enthusiast living in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. I am currently working as Product Innovation Lead
at the cybersecurity firm Forescout Technologies.

If you are viewing this page, it means that you probably know me or are interested in my profile or my services. Here you will find both information on my experiences and my past, current and (why not?) 
never started projects. Occasionally I will also post some reviews or advice on books and other interesting stuff.


## Professional Interests

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge. 
> -- John Naisbitt

I am interested in many topics, but currently I am focusing on the following:
* **Software architecture**, particularly for distributed applications. In my current
[company](https://www.forescout.com) I am working hard for migrating several core components of the product
portfolio from a monolothic design to a modern, cloud-ready architecture. 
* **Network security** and in particular how to leverage data mining and machine learning techniques
for modeling and correlating security events. In a nutshell, my team and I want to make 
security analysts' life easier.
* **Business innovation** and design thinking methods for successfully 
carry out innovation projects in corporate environment. Despite the wealth of information available,
corporate innovation has always been a [challenge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000768131400086X). I am involved in defining and implementing a streamlined innovation 
process across my organization.

[comment]: <> (A part from the above, I also try to keep an eye on the hot topics in physics and especially the quantum Monte Carlo community I contributed to during my PhD. And of course deep learning has arrived [there](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02487) too.)

Sometimes, I am also brushing up my physics knowledge with a fruitful ongoing
collaboration with the quantum computing firm [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/) which develops
chemistry simulation software for quantum computers. 

## Some of my projects

### qucochemistry
A [open source library](https://github.com/qu-co/qucochemistry) in Python for compiling 
and running quantum chemistry algorithms on the Rigetti's Forest computing platform. In this project, done in collaboration with [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/), I mainly contributed to 
the software infrastructure, unit testing
and code refactoring. More coming soon.

### TurboRVB
A very efficient and massively parallelized software package for executing quantum Monte Carlo simulation of materials developed in Fortran. I developed it during my PhD
thesis by adding new techniques for simulating solid materials. Unfortunately the code is still closed-source, which will hopefully change in the
future. You can find some more information [here](https://people.sissa.it/~sorella/web/index.html) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06205).

### minjob
A very simple Python library used for monitoring threads and subprocesses and restarting them in case of critical exception. You can see the code
on [GitHub](https://github.com/madagra/minjob).

### surfbot
A simple trading bot developed in Python for "surfing" on the very unstable 
cryptocurrency market. The code will be released open source ASAP.
