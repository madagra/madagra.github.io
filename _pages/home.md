**Welcome everyone!**

I am Mario, a scientific software developer and engineering manager based in the Netherlands.

I use this website to keep track of news in my [career](#career) and showcase some of the [projects](projects) 
I have been working on. I also occasionally (and hopefully in the future more regularly) write [blog posts](blog) 
on scientific software engineering, cloud computing, DevOps, and machine learning.

## Interests

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge.   
> -- John Naisbitt

I always loved working in small companies where my work has an immediate (and meaningful) impact. Currently, my main 
professional interests are:

- *Scientific software development*: this combines my two main passions of programming and science, 
especially physics. I have extensive experience in HPC, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.
- *Engineering and product management*: I love to start, grow, and continuously improve engineering teams and do the same the
with software products.
- *Cloud infrastructure and distributed applications*: I have extensive experience in building 
distributed systems running on public cloud, always with infrastructure-as-a-code.
- *Machine learning*: ML is a huge field. I have extensive experience with scientific ML 
and time series forecasting.

You can find more details on my previous works in the [blog](projects) and [projects](projects) or my

- **Sep 2020 - Feb 2024** - Head of quantum software at [PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/) (quantum computing): I planned and executed the
delivery of the first company cloud-based product. After a promotion (and an acquisition), I managed and grew up to 10 members 
a team of scientific software developers working on cutting-edge libraries 
for quantum computing and scientific machine learning.

- **Aug 2023** - [AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Associate](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mariodagrada_aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-activity-7097094576456224768-YJ-G?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop): 
AWS certification testing the knoweldge of its cloud services for building
high available and secure applications.

- **Apr 2019 - Jun 2019** - [Design-Driven Business Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/open-programmes-abs/design-driven-business-innovation/design-driven-business-innovation.html) 
at Amsterdam Business School: an intensive 3-months course which taught me how to ideate, prototype and 
execute innovation projects within a corporate environment. The course ended with an innovation project 
proposal which was accepted at my company.

- **Apr 2018 - Sep 2020** - Senior R&D software engineer and innovation lead at [Forescout](https://www.forescout.com/) (cybersecurity): 
a lot of coding and machine learning algorithms to improve the life of security analysts. 
After a promotion, I became the head of the product innovation team of the company where I led the prototype
and later integration into the main product line of several projects.

- **Aug 2016- Mar 2018** - R&D software engineer at [Atos Bull](https://atos.net/en/solutions/high-performance-computing-hpc) (HPC): 
a lot of low-level coding to make the interconnect of Atos supercomputers 
faster and help scientists running their codes at maximum efficiency. This has also been my first encounter 
with Agile since I acted as Scrum Master of a team of 8 for over a year.

- **Oct 2013- Oct 2016** - PhD in computational physics at Sorbonne University in Paris: simulations on high-temperature superconductors and a lot of writing, 
both scientific papers, a long [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01478313v1), but in particular highly efficient parallel 
scientific software.

- **Sep 2011- Sep 2013** - Master in Physics of Complex Systems from the Polytechnic University of Turin with a thesis on material simulations for fuel cells
