**Dear Internet surfer, welcome to my personal website!** 

I am Mario Dagrada, a researcher, developer and technology enthusiast living in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. I am currently working as VP of Quantum Software
at the quantum computing startup [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/) based in Amsterdam.

If you are viewing this page, it means that you probably know me or are interested in my profile or my services. Here you will find both information on my experiences and my past, current and (why not?) never started projects. Occasionally I will also post some reviews or advice on books and other interesting stuff.


## Professional Interests

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge. 
> -- John Naisbitt

The technology sector is a treasure trove of interesting and continuously evolving fields. I am interested in many of them, 
but currently my focus and energies are mainly on:

* **Software architecture and cloud technologies**, particularly for distributed applications. I am currently 
designing and implementing service-oriented applications on AWS, leveraging the best available tools for container
orchestration and infrastructure-as-a-code.

* **Quantum Computing**, particularly applied to quantum chemistry simulations. Quantum computing is for me one of the most
fascinating fields in technology. It combines, among other disciplines, two of my strongest passions (computer science
and physics) and is a diverse and continuosly evolving field in both academic and private sectors. Today is the right moment
to join the quantum computing space, but always beware of the marketing buzz around it.

* **Product management** and business innovation.
In my current role, I am applying the knowledge I acquired during my career on corporate innovation, design thinking and
software product management to the dynamic environment of an early stage startup at its first product release. My main goal 
is to build, from the start, a future-proof product strategy and a sustainable software release and innovation pipeline.

<!-- **Network security** and in particular how to leverage data mining and machine learning techniques
for modeling and correlating security events. In a nutshell, my team and I want to make 
security analysts' life easier.

(A part from the above, I also try to keep an eye on the hot topics in physics and especially the quantum Monte Carlo community I contributed to during my PhD. And of course deep learning has arrived [there](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02487) too.)

Sometimes, I also love to brush up up my physics studies thanks to a fruitful ongoing
collaboration with the quantum computing firm [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/). They develop
chemistry simulation software for quantum computers and we are building a very exciting platform, stay tuned!  -->

## Some projects I contributed to

### QUBEC, the quantum computing backend for chemistry
QUBEC is cloud platform which allows to execute chemistry simulations of molecules on the most advanced quantum computers to date. It has been developed in collaboration with
Schrodinger, world-leader in conventional chemistry simulations, and integrates with Schrodinger's
[Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro) chemical modeling suite to offer a glimpse on what the future of quantum chemistry simulations 
will look like! Check [here](https://quandco.com/product) to know more.

I am the main contributor of QUBEC and my role is two-fold. On one hand, I develop and maintain the cloud infrastructure, test automation and client 
APIs as well as contribute to the suite of cutting-edge quantum computing algorithms which powers QUBEC. On the other hands, I am responsible of product 
management, feature roadmap and in general all the processes associated with the launch, improvement and vision of a deep tech product. If you want to know 
more, please contact me at mario.dagrada@quandco.com.


### TurboRVB
A very efficient and massively parallelized software package for executing quantum Monte Carlo simulation of materials developed in Fortran. I developed it during my PhD
thesis by adding new techniques for simulating solid materials. Unfortunately the code is still closed-source, which will hopefully change in the
future. You can find some more information [here](https://people.sissa.it/~sorella/web/index.html) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07401).

### OpenMPI
OpenMPI is an [open-source library](https://www.open-mpi.org/) which implements the widely used Message Passage Interface (MPI) which standardizes the 
communications among tens of thousands of processors within the most powerful supercomputers in the world. I contributed to this project while working 
in the Atos Bull R&D department to make the library works efficiently with a high-speed network card built in-house.

### surfbot
A simple trading bot developed in Python for "surfing" on the very unstable 
cryptocurrency market. The code will be released open source ASAP.
