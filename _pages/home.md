**Hello everyone!**

I am Mario, an engineering manager with a strong technical background in scientific software development. 
I am currently based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

I use this website mainly for tracking my professional [career](#career) and showcase some of the [projects](projects) 
I have been working on. I also occasionally (and hopefully in the future more regularly) write [blog posts](blog) 
on scientific software engineering, cloud computing, DevOps, and machine learning.

## Interests

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge.   
> -- John Naisbitt

I always loved working in small companies where my work has an immediate (and meaningful) impact. Currently, my main 
professional interests are:

- *Scientific software development*: this combines my two main passions of programming and science, 
especially physics. I have experience in HPC, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.
- *Engineering and product management*: I love to start, grow, and continuously improve engineering 
teams and do the same the with software products, especially if they involve scientific/engineering foundations.
- *Cloud infrastructure and distributed applications*: I have experience in building 
distributed systems running on public cloud, always using infrastructure-as-a-code with no compromises.
- *Machine learning for science and AI engineering*: ML is a huge field. I have extensive experience with scientific ML, 
time series forecasting, and recently I ventured into the field of AI engineering, building AI infrastructure
leveraging large language models.

You can find more details on my previous works in the [blog](projects) and [projects](projects) or my

[Detailed CV in PDF](/assets/files/20240125_CV_Dagrada_scidev.pdf)

- **Jul 2024 - Present** - AI engineer and consultant (freelance): I put into practical
use my expertise in software architecture and development by helping several companies in building their AI infrastructure
and overall strategy. A couple of project highlights:

    - [Jupi](https://jupi.co/): I built the whole AI infrastructure from scratch for Jupi, a cool SaaS product for taking decentralized
decision within companies. I started very early in the company journey, setting up the LLM call pipelines, creating tools 
for evaluating the quality of the prompts and perform prompt engineering, adding tools and agentic capabilities
to the system, and (still ongoing), adding the whole memory layer to the AI agents for giving more informed answers 
to the decision-making.

    - [Onderlinge](https://www.onderlinge.info/): I made a 6-months PoC for this established insurance company in the
Netherlands. The goal was to leverage AI agents to analyze and produce
automatically the documentation of a really large legacy codebase, written in multiple languages, and very poorly documented.
The finaly accomplishment has been the automatic creation of a knowledge graph useful for navigating the codebase and
supported future migration initiatives in the company.

- **Feb 2024 - Jul 2025** - CTO at [Friday Energy](https://www.pasqal.com/) (scientific software, renewable energies): I led
and contributed to the modernization of the whole software platform (migrating from Python to Golang), doubled the 
size of the software team, started and nurtured the collaboration with several key partners, and strongly contributed 
to the roadmap and strategic company direction in terms of software and algorithm decisions. I could not do that 
without the help of several brilliant and highly motivated colleagues in the team.

- **Sep 2020 - Feb 2024** - Head of quantum software at [PASQAL](https://www.pasqal.com/) (scientific software, quantum computing): I planned and executed the
delivery of the first company cloud-based product. After a promotion (and an acquisition), I managed and grew up to 10 members 
a team of scientific software developers working on cutting-edge libraries 
for quantum computing and scientific machine learning.

- **Aug 2023** - [AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Associate](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mariodagrada_aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-activity-7097094576456224768-YJ-G?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop): 
AWS certification testing the knoweldge of its cloud services for building
high available and secure applications.

- **Apr 2019 - Jun 2019** - [Design-Driven Business Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/open-programmes-abs/design-driven-business-innovation/design-driven-business-innovation.html) 
at Amsterdam Business School: an intensive 3-months course which taught me how to ideate, prototype and 
execute innovation projects within a corporate environment. The course ended with an innovation project 
proposal which was accepted at my company.

- **Apr 2018 - Sep 2020** - Senior R&D software engineer and innovation lead at [Forescout](https://www.forescout.com/) (cybersecurity): 
a lot of coding and machine learning algorithms to improve the life of security analysts. 
After a promotion, I became the head of the product innovation team of the company where I led the prototype
and later integration into the main product line of several projects.

- **Aug 2016- Mar 2018** - R&D software engineer at [Atos Bull](https://atos.net/en/solutions/high-performance-computing-hpc) (scientific software, HPC): 
a lot of low-level coding to make the interconnect of Atos supercomputers 
faster and help scientists running their codes at maximum efficiency. This has also been my first encounter 
with Agile since I acted as Scrum Master of a team of 8 for over a year.

- **Oct 2013- Oct 2016** - PhD in computational physics at Sorbonne University in Paris: simulations on high-temperature superconductors and a lot of writing, 
both scientific papers and a long [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01478313v1) but especially highly efficient parallel 
scientific software.

- **Sep 2011- Sep 2013** - Master in Physics of Complex Systems from the Polytechnic University of Turin with a thesis on material simulations for fuel cells carried out in Paris.

## Some of my favourites

The passion for technology has always been at a core of my work, and I have a few ones I especially enjoyed working with:

- **PyTorch**: by far my favorite deep learning library due to its very intuitive
and Pythonic interface, nice and flexible differentiation engine, and super helpful community.
It is losing some traction nowadays, maybe at some point I will switch to Jax.

- **Vercel AI SDK**: the best tool for AI engineering if using Typescript. The sheer amount of
features and use cases supported can be intimidating, but once mastered it, one can basically do everything
with AI model at a very high pace.

- **FastAPI**: the best library to build backend APIs, in my opinion. And the quality of its documentation
is something rarely found in open-source projets.

- **SKtime**: provides a unified interface for time series analysis with excellent scikit-learn 
integration and great extensibility. There is basically everything for time-series in here while still
managing to keep a decent interface for the users.

- **Golang**: the language has its downsides (so hard to build proper tests, for example), but its concurrency 
programming model is, in my opinion, unparalleled and really makes the difference for large scale backend
applications. And well, it powers Kubernetes, one of the largest and most contributed open-source software
in the world.

- **Pulumi**: enables infrastructure-as-code using familiar programming languages and a super nice developer experience
both in the cloud and with the CLI. One needs to be particularly careful to properly organize the code, but then, unlike
Terraform, it becomes a real pleasure to work with.

- **PostgreSQL**: no need for explanations here, 40 years old and still going strong with really good features included
at each new major release. Actually, later it is doing better than most other NoSQL competing solutions, and
it is becoming more than just a database engine.
