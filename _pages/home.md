**Dear Internet surfer, welcome to my personal website!** 

I am Mario Dagrada, a researcher, developer and technology enthusiast living in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. I am currently working as VP of Quantum Software
at the quantum computing startup [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/) based in Amsterdam.

If you are viewing this page, it means that you probably know me or are interested in my profile or my services. Here you will find both information on my experiences and my past, current and (why not?) never started projects. Occasionally I will also post some reviews or advice on books and other interesting stuff.


## Professional Interests

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge. 
> -- John Naisbitt

I am interested in many topics, but currently I am focusing on the following:
* **Software architecture and cloud technologies**, particularly for distributed applications. I am currently 
designing and implementing service-oriented applications on AWS, leveraging the best available tools for container
orchestration and infrastructure-as-a-code.
* **Quantum Computing**, particularly applied to quantum chemistry simulations. Quantum computing is for me one of the most
fascinating fields in technology. It combines, among other disciplines, two of my strongest passions (computer science
and physics) and is a diverse and continuosly evolving field in both academic and private sectors. Today is the right moment
to join the quantum computing space, but always beware of the marketing buzz.
* **Business innovation** and design thinking methods for successfully 
carry out innovation projects in corporate environment. Despite the wealth of information available,
corporate innovation has always been a [challenge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000768131400086X). 
In my current role, I am applying the knowledge I acquired on corporate innovation to the much more dynamic environment
of an early stage startup, building a product strategy and a sustainable software release and innovation pipeline.

<!-- **Network security** and in particular how to leverage data mining and machine learning techniques
for modeling and correlating security events. In a nutshell, my team and I want to make 
security analysts' life easier.

(A part from the above, I also try to keep an eye on the hot topics in physics and especially the quantum Monte Carlo community I contributed to during my PhD. And of course deep learning has arrived [there](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02487) too.)

Sometimes, I also love to brush up up my physics studies thanks to a fruitful ongoing
collaboration with the quantum computing firm [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/). They develop
chemistry simulation software for quantum computers and we are building a very exciting platform, stay tuned!  -->

## Some projects I contributed to

### qucochemistry
A [open source library](https://github.com/qu-co/qucochemistry) in Python for compiling 
and running quantum chemistry algorithms on the Rigetti's Forest computing platform. In this project, done in collaboration with [Qu&Co](https://quandco.com/), I mainly contributed to 
the software infrastructure, unit testing
and code refactoring. More coming soon.

### TurboRVB
A very efficient and massively parallelized software package for executing quantum Monte Carlo simulation of materials developed in Fortran. I developed it during my PhD
thesis by adding new techniques for simulating solid materials. Unfortunately the code is still closed-source, which will hopefully change in the
future. You can find some more information [here](https://people.sissa.it/~sorella/web/index.html) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07401).

### surfbot
A simple trading bot developed in Python for "surfing" on the very unstable 
cryptocurrency market. The code will be released open source ASAP.
